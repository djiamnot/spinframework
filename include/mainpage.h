/** @mainpage SPIN (Spatial Interaction) Framework
*
*
* @section intro Introduction
* SPIN is a networked client/server framework, where a server called VESS
* (Virtual Environment State Server) maintains the state of the interactive 3D
* scene, and computes geometric interaction events. Various clients can connect
* to the server, sending messages to move content, or receiving messages from
* the server when the content has been moved, or when geometric events have
* occurred (e.g. an intersection of a user's avatar and a cube). Clients
* typically include edit/display programs, motion tracking systems, and mapping
* applications, which map the geometric events on to actions to control lights,
* sound, graphics, etc., and audio and graphic renderers.
