Server side tcp handlers
2)clients can connect on a port (in TCP) which is broadcast by the server in multicast. The client tells the server its listening port/ip (again for TCP), which the server maintains in a list.
3)a new callback for that TCP port that responds to the dumpState message. the server then dumps the state to the client in the connection maintained in its list of connections.
4)generic handler that dispatches calls to its callbacks (see bottom of SceneManager)
